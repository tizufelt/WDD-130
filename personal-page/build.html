        <h2>How to get a hold of us</h2>
  

        <h3>a Project</h3>
        <p>
          Get in touch with us and let us know what your intentions for the
          project are. We do anything from tune-ups to full restorations. If we
          are able and willing to take on the project, you can ship the vehicle
          our way so it can join the wait list. Your project isn’t on the wait
          list until it’s at our shop.
        </p>
        <h3>Project Start</h3>
        <p>
          We have a wait list, so it is likely we won’t start work on your car
          immediately. We do not charge for your vehicle to sit on our lot. Once
          the project reaches the top of the wait list, we will get in contact
          with you to be sure you are ready for work to begin.
        </p>
        <h3>Work & Billing</h3>
        <p>
          We only bill you when work is happening on your project. If you are
          unable to pay for work, we will stop working until you are able to
          pay. Cost is $85 per man-hour plus parts and supplies, billed out on
          Thursdays.
        </p>
        <h3>Turn-Around Time</h3>
        <p>
          the rustiest projects have between a 3-to-6-month turnaround time, but
          work is only done when both money and parts are available.
        </p>
        <h3>Final Delivery</h3>
        <p>
          You may drive your car away from shop when its ready, but if we’re too
          far away you can always hire a vehicle delivery driver to pick up the
          car and we will make sure it gets on the truck safely.
