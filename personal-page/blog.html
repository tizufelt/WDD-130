          What we do for fun, What you see here are a few different models of
          squarebody trucks. These models can all look the same to most people
          but to you and us we see differences. lets look at front grill and
          head lights
        </p>

        <p>Lets look at the mirrors and the shape of the doors</p>
        <p>Now look ath the hoods and see the sutle differences</p>
        <p>
          Produced from 1973 to 1987, Square Body trucks are the third
          generation of the Chevrolet and GMC C/K pickups. The Square Body
          moniker comes from their box-like shape, despite being named the
          “Rounded-Line” generation by Chevy. The trucks feature a rounded
          windshield, door frames, and windows that contrast the box-body
          design. The Square Body trucks were one of Chevy’s longest-running
          generations. With a 14-year production span, they aren’t as rare as
          other C10 generations, but they are easier to find. Their
          accessibility and affordability have made them popular choices for
          restorations and restomods.
