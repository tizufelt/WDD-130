        The mid-1970s were a weird time for the automotive industry. Following
        the oil embargo, and the subsequent sudden death of the muscle car,
        America’s car, and truck manufacturers were at a bit of a loss. Even the
        classic Ford Bronco was going through some major changes as the 70’s
        rolled on in. The endless reserves of power from the previous decades
        were no longer at the fingertips of engineers, and the ostentatious
        styling that came to define the era was no longer in vogue. Everything
        was changing, and the manufacturers like General Motors needed to
        quickly adapt in order to stay relevant, but how they would go about
        staying relevant was a tough proposition. General Motors had seen great
        success with their C/K line of pickup trucks from the 1950s to the early
        1970s, especially the “Action Line”, which really began the transition
        from a utilitarian vehicle that was at home on the farm, to a daily
        driver that included features more commonly found in General Motors line
        of sedans.

        At Auto Speed we’ve had the opportunity to work on many square-body GM
        trucks over the years, and we love them. Their styling exudes a classic
        American work ethic and makes them a perfect candidate for a classic
        truck restoration project that mixes the attitude of the past, with
        bespoke luxury and modern performance. How good was the square body C/K
        line of trucks from General Motors? So good that it would go on to a
        staggering 18-year production run. Ready to jump into exactly what made
        the aptly named square body generation of classic GM trucks as desirable
        as vehicles like old Ford Broncos in today’s market? Let’s get into it.
      </p>

      <div class="bg-image img3"></div>
      <p class="blogtext">
        First off, let’s cover why these trucks are called “square body”, which
        is especially confusing because General Motors internally referred to
        the third generation C/K as the “Rounded Line”. 1973 marked a major
        departure from the styling route that GM had become somewhat notorious
        for up until the 1970s. The term “square body” was actually a nickname
        given to this truck by members of the automotive press and the
        truck-loving public. To the casual observer, there is nothing round
        about the “rounded line” except for the headlights, but in fact, the
        entire truck was designed in a wind tunnel to be more aerodynamic.
        Internal reports at GM claim that the rounded line moniker came from a
        windshield with rounded corners, and a design that maximized airflow via
        the use of rounded-off corners where the hood met the fenders and
        rounded off doors that were integrated into the roof of the square body
        truck. Even the mirrors were more rounded to offer less wind resistance.
        Most of this was done in the interest of bumping fuel economy up for the
        venerable truck.

        Since the rest of the appearance of the C/K was quite straight and boxy,
        it instantly earned the nickname “square body”. This wide-shouldered
        appearance was not only attractive, but it provided a cab that was 2.5
        inches wider than the previous generation and a bed that was more
        commodious for cargo and larger items. Although it was much different
        than early Ford Broncos, the look was still tough and all – American.
        The result was a design that would receive only one refresh in 1981 and
        still goes down as one of the most attractive, and easiest-to-love
        classic pickup trucks for restoration.

        The sheer number of configurations available for the square body is
        staggering, which makes the square body truck one of the most appealing
        classic restoration candidates for buyers looking to get a classic look
        with modern features. Buyers could choose from a standard cab, or the
        aforementioned 4 door design, 3 wheelbase lengths, and 3 different bed
        configurations. GM marketed the trucks as ½ ton, ¾ ton, and 1 ton
        (nominal) capacities, along with 2 wheel drive or 4 wheel drive. C
        models are 2 wheel drive, while K models are designated as 4 wheel drive
        models. Although it deserves its own story, the square body generation
        also launched a worthy competitor to vintage Ford Broncos; the full-size
        Blazer.

        rim levels included the Cheyenne Super, Cheyenne, Custom Deluxe, and
        Custom. 1975 marked the introduction of the Silverado as the top trim
        for the C/K, and we all know the rest of the history for the iconic
        Silverado nameplate, but it all started with the square body. Every 2
        wheel drive square body utilized a high-strength steel frame, with a
        leaf spring rear suspension in the rear and an independent set up out
        front (4 wheel drive version had a different setup). This was a big
        departure from the coil spring set up on the action line and allowed the
        square body to handle bigger loads easier, while still providing a more
        cushioned, car-like ride that resonated with buyers. Brakes were power
        discs up front, with drums in the rear as standard equipment.
        Transmission choices ranged from either a three or four-speed manual
        transmission and a three or four-speed automatic transmission. K Series
        trucks offered a variety of 4 wheel drive systems, and a host of
        upgrades over their 2 wheel drive brethren like variable-rate leaf
        springs, specific suspension geometry, a live front axle (replacing the
        more car-like independent suspension), and running gear that was tucked
        up tight against the underside of the truck. GM also offered bash
        plates, and rock rails as factory options to compete with vehicles like
        vintage Ford Broncos that were aimed at the off-road market. 1973 to
        1981 models offered a full-time all-wheel-drive system as optional,
        while a conventional system came standard on all I6 equipped trucks.
        1981 brought not only a refreshed look but also the addition of shift on
        the fly all-wheel drive that could be activated at speeds up to 25 MPH.
