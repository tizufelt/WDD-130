          <h2>For the Love of Trucks!</h2>
          <p>
            We do this for the love of Chevy Squarebody trucks.
            We live, feel, and camaraderie experienced in a well-worn,
            well-loved truck. Remember the first time you rode in that classic
            truck next to your grandfather? Or the feeling you got when you
            plopped down on that old worn-out bench seat? We love and wrench on
            trucks and that is why we "do" what we "do", and we hope you feel the
            same. Let us help you tune up that old beater or complete an LS swap
            or even a complete restoration. Nothing is beyond us when it comes
            to squarebody trucks. Who we are and what we do Started in 2020 from
            when I couldnâ€™t get anyone to work on my truck, I saw I had a shop
            and the tools to do the work. Now we are a full-time restoration
            shop able to handle your needs. It is all about the story, the experience and the love. 
            <p> I hope you can let us in to your truck family and let us share our love of trucks with you.</p>
